# cpp-learning
Welcome! This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning the C++ programming language. 
It includes notes, example code, practice problems, and mini-projects as I explore C++ fundamentals and more advanced topics.

## What You'll Find Here:

- Basic syntax and input/output
- Control structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions and scope
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, etc.)
- Standard Template Library (vectors, maps, etc.)
- Pointers and memory management
- Practice problems and exercises
- Mini projects (e.g., calculator, game logic, file handling)
